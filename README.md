## Why ez?

ez was created with the ideia that a programming language can be simple and **clarity** without sacrificing security and perfomance.

-   **Strong, static and clear typing**: Ensures fewer bugs and easier maintenance with a types system that guides developers.
-   **consistent and readable syntax**: Makes code easier to write and understand, reducing cognitive load for developers.
-   **Native execution with real performance**: Delivers fast, efficient execution without relying on an external runtime.
-   **Built for production, not just experimentation**: Focuses on real-world use cases and stability.

The focus is on provides a language that any developer can quickly learn and use confidently in real-world applications.
