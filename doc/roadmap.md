# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and milestones for the ez programming language.

---

## Short-term

-   [x] Define core syntax
-   [ ] Implement basic type system (primitive and custom types)
-   [ ] Support built-in functions: `print()`, `input()`
-   [ ] String interpolation
-   [ ] Basic `for` loop with `range()`
-   [ ] Organize and write initial documentation

---

## Mid-term

-   [ ] Create a working compiler targeting native binaries
-   [ ] Add type-safe standard library
-   [ ] Implement control flow expansions: `if`, `match`, `while`, `break`, `continue`
-   [ ] Enable method definitions on custom types (e.g. `Type.method()`)
-   [ ] Introduce error handling model (`try`, `catch` or equivalent)

---

## Long-term

-   [ ] Develop a package manager and module system
-   [ ] Add built-in testing framework
-   [ ] Enable WebAssembly (WASM) compilation
-   [ ] Build editor support (syntax highlighting, LSP integration)
-   [ ] Optimize runtime and ensure memory safety
-   [ ] Design and release production-ready tooling

---

This roadmap is a living document and will evolve as the language and its community grow.
