## Why ez?

ez was created with the belief that a programming language can be simple and **readable** without compromising security and performance.

Key principles:

-   **Strong, static, and clear typing**: Ensures fewer bugs and easier maintenance with a type system that guides developers.
-   **Consistent and readable syntax**: Makes code easier to write and understand, reducing cognitive load for developers.
-   **Native execution with real performance**: Delivers fast, efficient execution without relying on an external runtime.
-   **Built for production, not just experimentation**: Focuses on real-world use cases and stability.

The goal is to provide a language that any developer can quickly learn and use confidently in real-world applications.
